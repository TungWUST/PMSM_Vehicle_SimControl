# Description

Firstly, please create an association with MATLAB/Simulink in CarSim. Once the association is established, the Simulink model will open automatically. Secondly, run ZH0303_SimParameters.m in MATLAB to import the parameters into the workspace. Finally, run ZH0303_SimVeh_PMSM_C to execute the simulation.

Note that the ZH0303_Simulink_Modules file provides some replaceable modules for different control methods.

No additional tools or libraries are required beyond the standard versions of MATLAB R2020a and CarSim 2020.0.
